# alexa-bluetooth-audio-block
A very simple website you can bookmark that plays an empty sound to prevent the alexa from going idle. Pretty much what lucabarile did with his windows application, but with this website you dont need to download anything, just make sure you allow media autoplay (same setting as youtube autoplay for audio and video in the browser permissions, in firefox this is located at the search bar).
